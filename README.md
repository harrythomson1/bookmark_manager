As a User
So that I can remember my favourite websites
I'd like to be able to see a list of my bookmarks

### To set up the database

1. Connect to psql
2. Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
3. Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
4. Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql

Connect to `psql` and create the `bookmark_manager` database:

```
CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
```

To set up the appropriate tables, connect to the database in `psql` and run the SQL scripts in the `db/migrations` folder in the given order.

Please make sure to set up the test database if you are looking to run tests for this application.

$> psql
admin=# CREATE DATABASE "bookmark_manager_test";
admin=# CREATE TABLE bookmarks(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, url VARCHAR(60));
